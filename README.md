# CS7051.G3

##Hi, welcome to Yesod Web Development world!

###1. What is this?
This project is the fourth part of the course final project named "A Distributed Platform for Codebase Analysis" in Trinity College Dubin. </br>
We design a website to support search over Github repositories where you can choose what you want to search, such as the complexity of your repository, lines of code, and No. of commits. </br>


###2. How to run?
(1)Download to your localhost first, and input the following in your command line </br>
    `cd ./CS7051.G3/G3UI` </br>
    `stack build` </br>
(2)Construct the running environment </br>
    `export the content from run.sh`
(3)Run the project </br>
    `stack exec G3UI`


###3. What is the result?
After running, when you visit localhost:3000, the search.hamlet will be displayed. You could start your repository performance trip :) </br>

*. The search results will be offered by other groups. When we finish the communication with other groups, we will update the routes and the results will be displayed for you.
